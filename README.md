# School Management System

### A Django + Next.js powered School Managament Web Application System equipped with various features!

<br>

> Status: **Paused Development**

> The site isn't 100% ready to be used practically (neither it is recommended to do so) but still works just fine. It is an educational project and is not meant to be used in production (unless you know what you're doing). I have to pause (or maybe stop?) it's development due to examinations, and since it was an assignment, I'll have to submit it now anyways. There are some known (minor) bugs to be fixed later but most of the site is still operable.

## Setup Guide

- Install and setup [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)).

- The project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as the default package manager, so it is recommended to have poetry installed in your system. In case you prefer to use [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) instead of poetry, refer to [Using pip as the package manager](#using-pip-as-the-package-manager).

- Git clone the repository and switch the current directory to the project directory

    ```bat
    git clone https://github.com/AkshuAgarwal/SchoolManagementSystem
    cd SchoolManagementSystem
    ```

- Install the required Packages:
    - Python:

        ```bat
        poetry install
        ```

        > **[Windows]**: In case the ValueError occurs while installing the packages, you can try deleting the `AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\artifacts` directory and retry installation. More Info <sup>[Github Issue](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4479) / [StackOverflow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69425375)</sup>

        > Refer to [Using pip as the package manager](#using-pip-as-the-package-manager) to setup using pip instead.

    - Node.js:

        ```bat
        npm install
        ```

- Setup Credentials and Variables:
    - Rename [`.env.example`](./.env.example) to `.env`.

    - Rename [`constants.json.example`](./constants.json.example) to `constants.json`.

    - Fill all the credentials and values accordingly. (Refer to [How to setup Credentials](#how-to-setup-credentials) for detailed guide).

- Setup Database
    - Run the given command to migrate the database to create required tables:

        ```bat
        poetry run python manage.py migrate
        ```

- Create Super User:
    > Note: If you just want to test the site, you can instead generate some pseudo data by using `generatesampledata` command. Refer to [Generating Sample Data](#generating-sample-data) for a detailed guide.

    > Or if you're running the site in production, you should create some superusers beforehand to access the site and admin panel, using the guide below:

    - To create one, run:

        ```bat
        poetry run python manage.py createsuperuser
        ```
    
        or (if using pip):
    
        ```bat
        # Unix/macOS
        python manage.py createsuperuser

        # Windows
        py manage.py createsuperuser
        ```

        and fill the fields accordingly.

- Start the project:
    - Start Redis Server on the given url listed in `.env`.

    - Make sure the PostgreSQL/MySQL server is running on the same credentials mentioned in `.env`.

    - Open a terminal and start the Django server:

        ```bat
        poetry run python manage.py runserver
        ```

        or (if using pip):

        ```bat
        # Unix/macOS
        python manage.py runserver

        # Windows
        py manage.py runserver
        ```

    - Open another terminal and start Next App:

        ```bat
        npm run dev
        ```

        To run the server on custom port, add the port number with argument `-p`, like:
        ```bat
        npm run dev -p 8080
        ```

        The default port is `3000`.

    - And your site is ready to go ðŸš€

> You don't need to take care of creating .venv yourself! Poetry automatically creates a venv in your project directory. If you're using pip instead of poetry, you may need to refer to [Using pip as the package manager](#using-pip-as-the-package-manager) for handling `.venv` creation and usage.

> You don't need to take care of creating any required directories by yourself. Django automatically checks for the required directories and creates them (if missing).

        ```
        and copy-paste the key. You can also create a strong secret key yourself!

## Generating Sample Data
- If you want to test the site, you may need to have some data preloaded in your database for most features of the site to work. Creating every set of data manually might be a hassle and time-consuming. For this, the application comes with a command to help you generate some minimal required data automatically!

- To generate the data, run:

    ```bat
    poetry run python manage.py generatesampledata
    ```

    or (if using pip):

    ```bat
    # Unix/macOS
    python manage.py generatesampledata

    # Windows
    py manage.py generatesampledata
    ```

    and it'll automatically load the data into the database without any hassle!

<br>

> Note: You must use a newly created database and not run this command twice with the same database as it may cause data collisions and improper data.

<br>

> You can use the credentials from the tables below to log into and operate the site.

## Using pip as the package manager

- Pip by default does not create a virtual environment. If you're planning to use pip, you'll have to create it by yourself.

- To create one, run the following command:

    ```bat
    # Unix/macOS
    python -m venv .venv

    # Windoes
    py -m venv .venv
    ```

    This will create a folder named `.venv` in your project root directory.

- Activate the virtual environment using:

    ```bat
    # Unix/macOS
    source ./.venv/bin/activate
    
    # Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate

    ```
    > To exit the environment, just type `deactivate`.
    
    After successfully installing and activating venv, you can now install the packages.

- The project also comes with `requirements.txt` (and `requirements.dev.txt` for dev dependencies) by which you can install the packages. To install, just run:

    ```bat
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- You have successfully installed packages using pip.

> Note that to run any command mentioned above with poetry, you must activate the venv first and then directly use `python` or `py` to run scripts.
